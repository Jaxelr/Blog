## Osx git clients

Sourcetree for Macos allows me to have a window with multiple repositories connected by ssh doing recurrent refresh every 15 minutes. The UI is intuitive and allows complex actions (git flow, interactive rebases) which saves me a substantial amount of time. It is also free, which is impressive enough. It feels smooth, and the bugs have been sparse, in my experience. Even though the SSH experience leaves a bit to be desired, and i do enjoy the 

## Windows git clients

Why i love Sourcetree 1.X:

* It allows me to fetch multiple repositories concurrently (this is by default every 15 mins.)
* I can switch between repositories by tab.
* Interactive rebase done easy.
* Folder organization its really helpful.
* Git flow compatible. 

Sourcetree 2.0 uses a different UI than the original Sourcetree 1.X. This newer UI doesnt feel as intuitive as the original version. I have kept myself on sourcetree 1.9 for now but newer issues have arisen:

* Managing Github 2 factor auth doesnt work.
* The app can get sluggish sometimes.
* Some bugs exists that require reboots.

Therefore i have decided to look for a newer Git client for windows. I will be testing the following apps:

1. Git Kraken (free version)
2. Git Tower (trial)
3. Fork (beta)
4. Sourcetree 2.0
5. GitExtensions
