# A use case for the value of data

There is a compromise we, as individuals, agree to upon when we decide to use services as related to the web. This is specially true on the part of free services, like Google, Twitter, Facebook. In the past, Apple has made headlines in the constant fight between our data and the ability for third parties to utilize it ([See here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-encryption-court-order-news/)), and of course they do have the incentive of being a hardware company first, unlike the other corporations.

Which bring us to Google. Google, as a service, provides wonderful information, tools and the ability to connect,  bring behaviors and patterns over the conglomerate information of my information. This, of course, is done with the consideration that the corporation will use this data, instead of prioritizing in favor of the user. A simple example of usable favorability for both the user and the system is Youtube, i see relevant videos from the sources i keep consuming.

After considering all this with regards to Google, the search engine, ive been sporadically using DuckDuckGo, for the past year, readying myself to make the transition. Lately I have become somewhat satisfied with the results, so i started giving it a try. 

## Ways to slowly move away from while using Chrome

By default Chrome uses google, of course, A simple remap of the default values of Chrome will suffice. But considering ive been a Google fan for at least 8 years. 

## Enter Firefox Quantum

Its been thoroughly hard for me to stop using Chrome perse in my daily routine mainly because of 3 things:

* Customizable Search engine bar
* Ram usage and overall performance
* Dev Tools

For the past 5-6 years i've evolved in my day to day usage and productivity has been steadily increasing, specially in terms of quick glances at specific sites i frequent (mainly, StackOverflow, HackerNews, Feedly...) 

I specifically remember switching from Firefox to Chrome because i felt the my productivity was way higher the moment i started using Chrome. The key example being that i used to Google everything and i felt my research and flexibility with chrome was way higher.
