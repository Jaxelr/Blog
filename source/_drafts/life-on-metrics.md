# Information overload(?)

The data spectrum that we continually provide to our devices is capable of allowing us to obtain greater insight into our day to day activities. The bigger problem is that most companies dont allow us to use it on demand, since the current characteristics of software interaction is through their lense. I am aiming to research into companies that allow me to recollect my data and use it as i care for.

- Todo: Research companies that share data with the user in a more insightful way.
