# Interviewing the Interviewee

In the tech market, the interviewing process is a great chance for individuals to discuss and evaluate topics that companies should prioritize. These are some of the relevant points i look for in a company with regards to work culture/environment.

## Tech Stack

Most companies tend to marry to some specific stack or language in order to allow them some sort of predictability in terms of the turnover of resources, while allowing expertise to be accumulated by the team members. For the most part, this is unnapealing since it leads to the inevtiable situation when Devs shoehorn certain stacks for difficult or inneficient uses.

## Methodology

No single methodological concept is the key to success. Given this fact, the process of developing solutions/products/processes require that a continual measurement is taken of the effort, result, methods. These days Agile/Scrum is the trendy topic, but each product requires the awareness to understand that even these methodologies are flawed and sometimes are not up to the same realities of the business needs and/or the environment used. This also ties neatly to capable team sizes, since the complexity added to working on large teams is indicative of the amount of waste in communication, organization and sluggish.

## Open Source

The biggest tech companies of the world are constantly giving back to the community and allowing their own libraries, frameworks and tools the capability to be shared freely giving us a reason to avoid reengeneering the same scalable options that they have used. Also exposing us to newer algorithms and design patterns.  In todays market it is key for local companies to leverage this capability and also to allow the teams to contribute time.

## Testing (Unit/Integration)
