# An uncomfortable reality

For the past 3 years i have started to become uncomfortable with the reality in amount of data that google compiles in regards to their users. I dont plan on guessing motives behind this, i understand this is a compromise we made once we agreed to use their services. 

I specifically remember switching from Firefox to Chrome because i felt the my productivity was way higher the moment i started using Chrome. The key example being that i used to Google everything and i felt my research and flexibility with chrome was way higher.

Gradually
