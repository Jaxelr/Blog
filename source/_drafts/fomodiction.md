## Fomodiction

My biggest current challenge, in terms of controlling my own impulses, is my inhability to let go of my RSS feeds for more than a day. Even though it is a curated list of only around 50 sources, the stream of news is constant and plenty in terms of reading material (Around 800 messages a day). This post is my self documenting journey into managing the anxiety with regards to not checking my feeds.

The frequency varies depending on the day, with weekdays being the most active days and weekends being very low. My goal is to separate specific times for the activity and avoid rushing into the phone whenever i feel like i am not doing anything.

### Initial plan:

1. Document the daily usage of rss feeds.
    * One morning reminder to document the checks.
    * One evening reminder to pass the info to this post.
2. Keep the usual ratio to determinehow much time is consumed.
3. Determine which moments to skip the activity and focus on other relevant activities (Think of details...).

I consciously checked my rss feeds at least 10 times today. 

    - When i woke up.
    - After shower.
    - Bathroom break
    - 11 am work break.
    - Lunch.
    - Buying coffee.
    - Idle at work.
    - Bathroom break
    - Walking into the car.
    - Prior to writing these posts (8 pm)

With the help of reminders could finally check all the times i marked:

    - 4:30 am woke up and check them.
    - 8:00 am before preparing for work.
    - 8:37 am while driving to work on red lights.
    - 12:10 pm at lunch.
    - 2:27 pm bored at work.
    - 6:28 before dinner.
    - 7:30 while at parents house.

So far consciously knowing that i am checking the feeds helps to calm myself of the constant anxiety. Also, im gonna theorize than when im with the kids i barely get time to check them, because i dont feel completely idle.

As theorized, weekends are way more active for me, therefore, i barely check. Also, not so many news and articles are posted on weekends.

    - 7:00 am waking up.
    - 2:00 pm idle at home.
    - 8:00 pm at dinner.

Ill see if the pattern continues tomorrow (i suspect it will).

#### Sunday, February 18th, 2018:

Far less time today, as expected.
    - 9:00 am waking up.
    - 9:00 pm going to bed early.

Let see how the tempo goes up tomorrow.
