There is a certain type of developer that tends to overvalue code built by his or herself. Even if one does not particulary believe to be the greatest 10x developer in the world. Perhaps this notion is constructed on the fact that we can grasp the amount of time and/or effort dedicating into solving that specific type of problem. In general terms this means that we tend to acquire certain bias leaning towards our own creations. I speak this in terms of my own awareness as a developer, and not entirely based on a specific target person, although ive seen this happen a few times.

This behavior reminded me of the idea behind the [Ikea Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect) and although there is great feeling of acomplishment withing ourselves, we sometimes fall into the trap of believing that finding a vendor or third party library that does something we did on a more comprehensive fashion, this devalues us as resources. Im always reminded of the quote: "You are not your code.", this mantra inspires me to understand that from all my experiences on failures or triumphs, we can accomplish a superior version of whatever we did. But this also requires that we stay wary of what are the lessons to be learn from our experiences developing solutions.
