# A use case for the value of our data

There is a compromise we agree to upon when we decide to use services as on the web. This is specially true on the part of free services, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft. In the past, Apple has made headlines in their ongoing fight between our data and the ability for third parties to utilize it ([Like this](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-encryption-court-order-news/)), and of course, considering they do have an incentive to do so, of being a hardware company first, unlike other corporations.

Which brings me speicifically to Google. Google, as a service, provides wonderful information, tools, the ability to connect, bring behaviors and patterns over the conglomerate my data, as recollected by them. This is done with the consideration that the corporation will use this data for my benefit, but also prioritizing in favor of the corporation. A simple example of usable favorability for both the user and the system is Youtube, i see relevant videos from the sources i keep consuming, specially information with regards to people i wouldnt possible be able to get to know, while being thousands of miles away of them.

Therefore, after considering all this with regards to Google, the search engine, ive been sporadically favoring DuckDuckGo for the past year. Trying to become ready to make the transition, while observing what benefits i will lose with using Google Search Engine. Lately I have become somewhat satisfied with the results of DDG, and so i've started to avoid Google. 

## Ways to slowly move away from while using Chrome

By default Chrome uses google, of course, A simple remap of the default values of Chrome will suffice. But considering ive been a Google fan for at least 8 years. 

## Enter Firefox Quantum

Its been thoroughly hard for me to stop using Chrome perse in my daily routine mainly because of 3 things:

* Customizable Search engine bar
* Ram usage and overall performance
* Dev Tools

For the past 5-6 years i've evolved in my day to day usage and productivity has been steadily increasing, specially in terms of quick glances at specific sites i frequent (mainly, StackOverflow, HackerNews, Feedly...) 

I specifically remember switching from Firefox to Chrome because i felt the my productivity was way higher the moment i started using Chrome. The key example being that i used to Google everything and i felt my research and flexibility with chrome was way higher.
