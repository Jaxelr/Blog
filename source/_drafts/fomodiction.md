## Fomodiction

My biggest current challenge, in terms of controlling my own impulses, is my inhability to let go of my RSS feeds for more than a day. Even though it is a curated list of only around 50 sources, the stream of news is constant and plenty in terms of reading material (Around 800 messages a day). This post is my self documenting journey into managing the anxiety with regards to not checking my feeds.

The frequency varies depending on the day, with weekdays being the most active days and weekends being very low. My goal is to separate specific times for the activity and avoid rushing into the phone whenever i feel like i am not doing anything.

### Initial plan:

1. Document the daily usage of rss feeds.
    * One morning reminder to document the checks.
    * One evening reminder to pass the info to this post.
2. Keep the usual ratio to determinehow much time is consumed.
3. Determine which moments to skip the activity and focus on other relevant activities (Think of details...).


#### Thursday, February 15th, 2018:

I consciously checked my rss feeds at least 10 times today. These are the ones i remember vividly today:
    - When i woke up.
    - After shower.
    - Bathroom break
    - 11 am work break.
    - Lunch.
    - Buying coffee.
    - Idle at work.
    - Bathroom break
    - Walking into the car.
    - Prior to writing these posts (8 pm)
