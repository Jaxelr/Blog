# A use case for my data

I understand there is a compromise we make once we agree to use  services of one of the big 4 in tech. In the past Apple has made headlines in the constant fight between our data and the ability for third parties to utilize it ([See here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-encryption-court-order-news/)), but the other 3 big corps (Amazon, Google, Facebook) havent been so keen in going completely legal on federal authorities.

The truth is i havent felt comfortable at all with the idea of corporations profiting on my data with benefit for me. In the specific case of Google, i dont mind using useful services like Gmail, Google Docs. Im aware of the interoperability between all these devices into some sort of ecosystem, which mainly benefits Android users on mobile, Chrome OS users on desktop and people who exclusively interact with google services on the cloud, but i havent seen major disadvantages as related to the search engine.

Considering all this, ive been sporadically using DuckDuckGo, for the past year, readying myself to make the transition. Lately I have become somewhat satisfied with the results, so i started giving it a try. 

The first consideration i had to use was remapping all my search engine bars to use duckduck while using the same hotkeys/commands for google. That way it would feel like a natural transition in terms of muscle memory.

## Enter Firefox Quantum

Its been thoroughly hard for me to stop using Chrome perse in my daily routine mainly because of 3 things:

* Customizable Search engine bar
* Ram usage and overall performance
* Dev Tools

For the past 5-6 years i've evolved in my day to day usage and productivity has been steadily increasing, specially in terms of quick glances at specific sites i frequent (mainly, StackOverflow, HackerNews, Feedly...) 

I specifically remember switching from Firefox to Chrome because i felt the my productivity was way higher the moment i started using Chrome. The key example being that i used to Google everything and i felt my research and flexibility with chrome was way higher.
